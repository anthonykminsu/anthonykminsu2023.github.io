X corp, formerly known as Twitter, is a online social media platform founded in July 2006. The service allows users to post text, images, and videos in a social networking environment. Users can also interact with other users by liking, reposting (known as retweeting), or by replying to a public post. The platform also comes with a direct messaging for all registered users. The company was founded by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass. The company first launched in July 2006 in San Francisco, California under the name Twttr. 

## Origins
Twitter's origins lie in a "daylong brainstorming session" held by board members of the [podcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast) company [Odeo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeo). [Jack Dorsey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Dorsey), then an undergraduate student, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group. 

The turning point in Twitter's rise to popularity occurred at the 2007 South by Southwest Interactive (SXSWi) conference. During the event, Twitter usage surged from 20,000 tweets per day to 60,000. Newsweek's Steven Levy noted, "The Twitter people strategically placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages." Conference attendees constantly checked Twitter, with panelists, speakers, and bloggers mentioning and praising the service. The reception at the conference was overwhelmingly positive. Twitter staff even won the festival's Web Award prize, expressing their gratitude in 140 characters or less with the quip, "we'd like to thank you in 140 characters or less. And we just did!"

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Twitter saw significant growth but also became a hub for pandemic-related misinformation. To counter this, Twitter started flagging misleading tweets and linking to fact-checks. In response to marked tweets from President Donald Trump, he signed an executive order attempting to weaken Section 230, which protects social media platforms. Twitter eventually banned Trump, citing policy violations, sparking debates about freedom of speech.

## Social Impacts 
The company experienced rapid initial growth. In 2009, Twitter won the "Breakout of the Year" (Webby Award) On November 29, 2009, Twitter was named the Word of the Year by the [Global Language Monitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Language_Monitor), declaring it "a new form of social interaction". In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day. By March 2010, the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#cite_note-56)


## Features and Technologies
Users can post via the Twitter website, compatible external applications such as (SMS) and is available in certain countries. Users may subscribe to other users' posts—this is known as "following" and subscribers are known as "followers" or "tweeps", a portmanteau of Twitter and peeps. Individual posts can be forwarded by other users to their own feed, a process known as a "repost". In 2015, Twitter launched "quote tweet" (originally called "retweet with comment"), a feature that allows users to add a comment to their post, imbedding one post in the other. Users can also formerly "favorite" individual tweets.
